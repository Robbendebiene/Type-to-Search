#### [<img align="right" src="https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addons-buttons/AMO-button_2.png">](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/type-to-search/) Your next web search is just a key away. Just type on your keyboard to open a search bar and search with one of your search engines.


***

**How does it work?**

Whenever your caret is not positioned in any writeable input field, you can immeditly search with the *Type to Search* search bar by pressing any character key. Optionally you can define a trigger key, to only open the search bar when this particular key is pressed.

**Features:**

- Switch between your browser's search engines via up/down arrow keys, mouse wheel or by typing in keywords at the beginning of a search. Keywords can be assigned in the search section of the Firefox settings.
- Automatically appends the selected text (if any) to the current search. You can also press the enter key to open the search bar containing only the current text selection.


**Limitations:**

 - *Type to Search* does not work on Mozilla related pages like [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org), internal pages like about:addons or other add-on option pages (e.g. moz-extension://*). This is because Firefox restricts add-ons from accessing these pages for security reasons.
 - The page must be partially loaded in order to use *Type to Search*.
